This is my first coding exercise in ABC Browser Circus class.

*What I have learned*
I reviewed many concepts from communications lab like for loop, create elements, onclick function, flexbox, math random and so on.

*What difficulty do I meet*
I first created squares one by one through changing the left value of each square in the for loop. I also wanted them to rank line by line, so I applied flexbox. However, I didn't notice that the flexbox conflicted with the position of each sqaure that I specified (thanks to help from fellow Zeping Fei). Afrer I noticed this, I abandoned the line of code "el.style.left = 100 + i*100+ "px";"in JavaScript. It turns out that the easier code works better!
