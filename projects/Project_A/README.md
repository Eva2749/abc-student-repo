#Description
This project is aimed to challenge one's belief about google as a mechanic searching tool. The user types things to google search as normal, only to find himself/herself run into a seemingly live being. The being can perform different activities as user moves, clicks, enters and drags. After an interesting journey, the user will click the google search icon to go back to search. Such an unintentional attempt, however, hurts the being emotionally. In the end, the user will be informed that the being is actually a product of the past---when google was at early development, people created it as a form of exploring the possibility of web. However, the being was forgotten now, as google now is rendered as a searching tool for the world. The being can only be alive when people interacts with it, suggesting an intimate relationship between user and the being. The long sleep of the being indicates that people nowadays have already forgotten about it. The emotional website is aimed to recall the nostalgia of early web development when the charming of websites prospers. It also challenges people's belief about what a website can be--- more than a tool.
