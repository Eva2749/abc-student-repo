Lialina’s recollection of early web development culture brings my focus back to the web as a media platform that allows people to express themselves. The meanings behind “under construction” and outer space background shock me as examples of vernacular in the early web space. Today’s websites are mostly formal information sites which are finished product alike. Never have I thought of websites as simply a form of expression, a connection, or a project in progress. Lialina’s question probes further into the human-web relationship: “when it’s intertwined with our daily lives and filled by people who are not excited by the mere fact of its existence?” The vernacular of the old webs is cultural representation of the unique relationship between early developers and the web, contrasting the common notion today which regards websites as tools for practical purpose. Today’s websites are more about providing information, rather than medium for expression. That said, the medium itself is overlooked and thus no one cares about the fact that the web exists.

Lialina’s attempt to recall web history is indeed a restoration of cultural heritage. The reduction of starry sky background reflected her nostalgic feeling about people’s change in their attitude towards the web. But I could still find some residual of the old web vernacular in today’s web. The company I’ve interned before use starry sky as official website background. Though deviating from the “future tech” feeling, it uses star as their expression for company value. Here’s the link: http://www.hackhealth.com.cn/pc.html
